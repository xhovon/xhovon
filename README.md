### Hi there, I'm Xhovon 👋

I am an AI Engineer passionate about building scalable, production-ready systems. My focus is on bridging the gap between research and application using **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and Multimodal Architectures**.

I love working with **FastAPI** to serve models and am currently deep-diving into **Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)** and model fine-tuning.

#### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **AI & ML:** Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG, VLM, Stable Diffusion, PyTorch, Transformers.
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, REST APIs.
* **Data:** PostgreSQL (pgvector), MongoDB, Redis.
* **Ops:** Linux, Git, GPU Optimization.

#### 🔭 What I'm working on
* Building high-performance **RAG pipelines** for document retrieval.
* Experimenting with **Vision-Language Models (VLM)** for real-time image analysis.
* Optimizing inference latency for production environments.
