### Hi, I'm Xhovon 👋

I am a **Computer Science Graduate** and an **AI Engineer** with a strong foundation in classical Machine Learning and Algorithms. 

I am currently bridging the gap between Data Science and Production Engineering. After mastering the mathematical foundations of ML (building algorithms from scratch), I am now building scalable systems using **FastAPI**, **LLMs**, and **RAG Architectures**.

#### 🚀 Featured Projects (GenAI & Backend)
* **RAG-Learning-Demo:** A FastAPI backend designed to "read" documents and answer questions using Vector Embeddings (LangChain/FAISS). *[Current Focus]*
* **NoCode ML App:** A andrroid for training Machine Learning models without code. *(Repo: ncm.github.io)*

#### 🧠 Machine Learning Foundations
* **Linear Regression from Scratch:** Implementation of regression algorithms using pure math/Python (no libraries) to understand the underlying calculus.
* **Heart Disease Prediction:** A complete medical classification model exploring feature engineering and model evaluation.
* **ML Portfolio Sprint:** My documented 20-day intensive sprint to master core ML concepts and algorithms.

#### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Modern AI:** LLMs, RAG, OpenAI API.
* **Core ML:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter.
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Python.
* **Math:** Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability.
